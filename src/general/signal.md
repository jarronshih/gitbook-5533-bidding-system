# General Signal
In general, we use UDCA.
In suit contract, we prefer `Attitude` > `Counting` > `Suit preference`.

## Signaling Techniques
- Attitude signals: low encourages; high discourages
- Count signals: high odd; low even
    - What a count signal shows: present count
- Suit-preference signals: high prefers higher suit; low prefers lower suit


## Signal Meanings
### Partner's lead
When following to partner's lead: attitude (at trick one, discouraging signal suggests the ability to support the obvious shift), but:
- (?)suit-preference when a high honor is led and dummy has a singleton and can trump
- (?)count at trick one when not beating dummy's card or finessing and dummy's highest is the jack or lower or the equivalent

### Declarer's or Dummy's lead
When following to declarer's or dummy's lead: count (but see Smith, below)

When following suit in trumps: count

When discarding:
- from sequences and interior sequences with significant trick-taking ability: highest equal
- first discard in a particular suit: attitude
- second discard in a particular suit: count
- discard relating to a different suit: suit-preference

When splitting honors as second hand: king from ace-king; otherwise highest equal

### Throughout the defense
Throughout the defense:
- Special situations where count takes precedence: at trick one against a suit slam after a king-lead
- In general, unusual play shows unusual holding or requests unusual play.
- Smith: Against notrump, each defender's first card played after trick one that does not need an emergency meaning(such as count in dummy's long suit, 5 cards suit)is an in-context attitude signal relating to the suit of the opening lead.
