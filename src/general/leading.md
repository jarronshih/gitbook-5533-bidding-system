Against notrump contracts:

## Lead A or K
### High level Contract
- Lead A ask for attitude
- Lead K ask for count

When defensing a high level (over 5) contract,
we need to cash AK if possible and distinguish the suit count.
So when we lead with A, partner must tell us he has K or not.
If lead with K, partner must tell us the count so we can decide to cash out or switch.


## Partner's suit
(?) We lead `3rd/5th` in partner's suit so he could read our card count.


## After Partner's Double
### Overcall then Double
Don't lead my suit.
### Unusual Double on 3N
Please lead dummy's suit or weird suit.
