# Two Over One


## Description
We put `12~15 HCP` forcing game balance hands to Forcing 1NT, so `1M-2m` promise 5+ cards.

After response, we use `2M` as a default minimum bid and `3M` shows a good hand w/ good 6+M. Any bids higher than `2M` shows extra value.

## (?)
- (?) 1M-2N shows a good hand w/ not-very-good 6+M.
- (?) 1S-2H; - ??
