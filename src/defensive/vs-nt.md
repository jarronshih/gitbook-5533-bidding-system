# Against NT
Lionel against strong NT, Lionel if passed hand, Astro against strong NT.

## Strategy
We define the range of NT include 16 or above as Strong NT.
For example: 14~16, 15~17, 16~18, etc.

For the range of NT below 15 as Weak NT.
For example: 10~12, 11~13, 12~14, 13~15, etc.


## Lionel
{% bids %}
(1!N) - ??
Dbl := !S + any suit.
2!C := !C + !H, 10+ HCP. (2x=NF, 3x=INV)
2!D := !D + !H, 10+ HCP. (2x=NF, 3x=INV)
2M  := 6+M. (2!N=Ogust, raise=constructive)
2!N := Both minors.
{% endbids %}

After (1!N)-2M-2!N, overcaller should bid 3x with a weak two hand, and jump to game with a full opening hand.


## Astro
{% bids %}
(1!N) - ??
Dbl := 14+ HCP, partner can pass
2!C := !H + any suit, 10+ HCP
2!D := !S + any suit, 10+ HCP
2M  := 6+M
2!N := Very good hand, two touching suit 6-5, !S!H/!H!D/!D!C/!C!S
{% endbids %}
