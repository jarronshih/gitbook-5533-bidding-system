# Against NT
Lionel against strong NT, Lionel if passed hand, Astro against strong NT.

## Strategy
We define the range of NT include 16 or above as Strong NT.
For example: 14~16, 15~17, 16~18, etc.

For the range of NT below 15 as Weak NT.
For example: 10~12, 11~13, 12~14, 13~15, etc.


## Lionel
{% bids %}
(1!N) - ??
Dbl := 10+, !S+any suit.
2!C := 10+, !H+!C. (2x=NF, 3x=INV)
2!D := 10+, !H+!C. (2x=NF, 3x=INV)
2M  := 6+M. (2!N=Ogust, raise=constructive)
2!N := !D+!C, 11 cards in two suits.
{% endbids %}

After `(1!N)-2M-2!N`, overcaller should bid 3x with a weak two hand, and jump to game with a full opening hand.


## Astro
{% bids %}
(1!N) - ??
Dbl := 14+, partner can pass
2!C := 10+, !H+any suit
2!D := 10+, !S+any suit
2M  := 6+M
2!N := Very good hand, two touching suit 6-5. !S+!H or !H+!D or !D+!C or !S+!C
{% endbids %}
