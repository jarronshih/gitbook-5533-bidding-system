# Michaels Cue-Bid and Unusual No-Trump
Promise intermediate range 10~15 HCP. `(1!C) - 2!D` is Michaels.

## Michaels Cue-Bid
### Special case
If `1!C` only promise 3 cards or less, we use `2!C` as nature and `2!D` as Michaels.

{% bids %}
(1!C) - ??
2!C := NAT
2!D := Michaels Cue-Bid
{% endbids %}
